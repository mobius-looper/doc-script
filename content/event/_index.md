Most scripts that you will write are *action scripts*.  You use them in the same way as you would
use a built-in function, by creating a *binding* between the script and an external trigger.
When you manually press that trigger, the script is run.

Another category of scripts is *system scripts*.  These are not run from a binding, instead
they are run automatically as a side-effect of things that happen within the system.  The two most common are *event scripts* and *periodic scripts*.
