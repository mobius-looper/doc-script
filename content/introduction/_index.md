Scripts provide a powerful way to change the way Mobius behaves.  They can be used for many things, some of the most common are:

* Emulate the way footswitch buttons behave on a familiar hardware looper
* Combine a complex sequence of commands into one button press
* Buttons that do different things each time you press them
* Adjusting multiple tracks at exactly the same time
* Waiting until the loop reaches a certain state before doing something

Scripting is a complex topic that may seem intimidating at first, but it is well worth the time to learn.   Scripts may be written by others and shared, so even if you do not wish to write your own scripts, you should be familar with the ways scripts are installed and used.  Start by reviewing the examples in this introductory section to get an idea of what scripts can do and what they look like.  

### What Are Scripts?

Scripts are short text files containing instructions for Mobius to follow.  These instructions are written in a language called Mobius Scripting Language or MSL for short.  Because scripts are files, you can create them with any text editor, though the examples here will use the *Script Editor* that is built in to Mobius.  If you have used simple text editors like *Notepad* on Windows or *TextEdit* on Mac, you should be able to use the Script Editor.  You *should not* use word processors like *Word* or *Pages* to create script files.
