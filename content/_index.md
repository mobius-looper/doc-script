Scripting provides a way to customize the behavior of Mobius to meet the needs of your performance style.  You can use scripts for many things, some popular examples include:
 
- Combining several commands so they all happen when a single MIDI switch is pressed
- Waiting until the loop reaches an exact moment in time such as a beat or bar, then doing something
- Setting up multiple tracks at the beginning of a song
- Changing track mixes in the middle of a song

If you have any programming experience, the concept of a scripting language should be
familiar.  If you are not a programmer, scripts may seem intimidating but they are worth
learning to get the most out of Mobius.  Scripts can be written by others and shared, so
you may only need to know how to install them but won't need to write them.

Begin by working through the examples in the *Introduction* section.  This will explain what scripts are, how to make them, and how to run them.
